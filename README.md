## Introduction
Welcome to the Fake News Detection project! In today's digital age, the spread of misinformation is a significant concern. This project leverages the power of Neural Networks to tackle the issue of fake news by analyzing news headlines and classifying them as either real or fake.

**Note:** Initially, we experimented with the Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB) model, and the classifications appeared to be correct. However, seeking to explore the potential of Neural Networks, we decided to construct a custom model with the assistance of ChatGPT. Our aim is to compare the results of the Neural Network with the initial MultinomialNB model.

## Description

The project aims to create a model capable of distinguishing between true and false news, thereby contributing to mitigating the spread of misleading information.

## Key Features

- Text analysis to identify common traits of fake news.
- Utilization of machine learning algorithms for news classification.

## System Requirements

- Python 3
- Machine learning libraries such as pandas, numpy, sklearn and tensorflow.
- Other specific requirements for your development environment.
